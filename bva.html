<strong class='header'>brain + visual art</strong>
</br>
The following is a basic diagram illustrating the pathways in the brain that play roles in vision, perception, and creation of meaning. When working together, these brain regions allow for a complex understanding of visual artifacts, including art. Select the pathways below to explore how each contributes.

Today, many researchers are dedicated to bridging the gap between neuroscience and the study of aesthetics. The goal is to understand how visual inputs are transfigured from light to neural chemistry, and then somehow emotion, memory, and most importantly: meaning. It might make sense to take a scientific approach to understanding how viewers of art and their environment process their surroundings. After all, mental images, memories, and emotions are just neural constructs. It helps to know what brain areas light up when something beautiful or terrifying is viewed. However, there is the experimental issue of defining and operationalizing ‘beautiful’. We may all agree that a landscape on the Savannah is beautiful, but its features averaged together may create a kitsch likeness. The same goes for a model’s mole-blemished face that is still more attractive than the flawless, ‘averaged’ face of several models. Moreover, many researchers will look at the brain’s ‘pleasure’ to assess reactions to beauty. But is it fair to equate beauty and pleasantness? Maybe in some contexts, but often times beauty can be bitter, sad, or altogether unpleasant. For now, continued work both in the mapping of relevant brain areas that form the ‘consciousness of the aesthetic,’ as well as the philosophical exploration of beauty within psychology is needed.</div>
